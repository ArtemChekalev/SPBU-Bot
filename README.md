# SPBU-Bot
This is a repository of Saint Petersburg State University Telegram Bor for applicants. 
####Now it has following functionality:
1. A functions button. By clicking it, you will see all Bot's realized functions.
2. A navigate button. There are 3 types of navigation: by edu's name, by edu's code and by block of edus. 
- If you choose the first type, you will have to write a name of edu you want to know about, than, if this name is found, you will get all information about it. 
- If you choose the second type, you will have to write a code of edu that you are interested in. After it, you will get 1 or more edus in SPBU, that correspond to the code you've written.
- If you choose the third type, you can click a button with a block you want to see. Then, you will have a list of all edus in the block. You can have information about any edu by writting it's name, or you can write "Выход" to work with other Bot's functions.
3. A career guidance button. By clicking it, you'll be offered to pass the Golland's test, which has 42 questions. After passing it, you will have a list of professions that are suitable for you and an SPBU edu that you can choose.

In the future Bot will have more functions that can be useful an interesting for a user. Thank you for your interest in the project!
